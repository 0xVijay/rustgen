efficiencyRules:
  testing:
    - Always create single test file per feature
    - Use minimal test data to avoid token waste
    - Test one functionality at a time
    - Keep test files under 100 lines
    - Download and reuse BIP39 wordlist - never recreate
    - Use real test data: "tooth person moment alley frost island clarify gain what frozen mesh spin" -> 0x42fdd3524A3454f61829b59b208612BCEFC37eF4
  development:
    - Prefer single-line terminal output over multi-line
    - Use progress bars instead of verbose logging
    - Implement checkpointing for long-running processes
    - Optimize for speed over memory in critical paths
  codeOrganization:
    - Keep each file under 500 lines
    - Split large files into logical modules
    - Reuse existing functions and utilities
    - Avoid code duplication
